## How Challenges Broken Up
There will be one solution with at least one class library that will hold the different functions for the challenges. There will also be a XUnit Test project that will provide the Unit Tests for the solutions.

### DailyChallengesLib
This is a class library that holds all the functions to the daily challenges.

### DailyChallenges.Tests
This is an XUnit Test Project that provides the UnitTests for the solutions. It has a reference to the  `DailyChallengesLib`  project and will unit tests all the solutions.
