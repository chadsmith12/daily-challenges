# Daily Challenges
This is an attempt to solve the Daily Challenges that are posted on dev.to that are from CodeWars. 
The series of challenges start from [here](https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-1-string-peeler-4nep).

## How the challenges are broken up
Every challenge will have their own directory and individual README that explains what each challenge is about, what the challenge specifically is, example input and output, and a link to the original posting.

Each challenge could be solved in multiple languages and each language it is solved in will in their own directory in each individual challenge.
