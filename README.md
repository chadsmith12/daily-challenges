# Daily Challenges
This is an attempt to solve the Daily Challenges that are posted on dev.to that are from CodeWars. 
The series of challenges start from [here](https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-1-string-peeler-4nep).

## How the challenges are broken up
The challenges can/will be solved in different languages. Most challenges will at least be solved in C#. There will be a directory for each language, and each language will solve the challenges their own way.

Inside each language directory will be a README that explains how each challenge is solved in that language and instructions on how run the challenges for that language.
